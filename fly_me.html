  <pre>
  I used to think that I could not go on
  And life was nothing but an awful song
  But now I know the meaning of true love
  I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
  
  [Refrain]
  If I can see it, then I can do it
  If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
  
  [Chorus]
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can touch the sky
  I think about it every night and day
  Spread my wings and fly away
  I believe I can soar
  I see me running through that open door
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can fly (Woo)
  
  [Verse 2]
  See I was on the verge of breaking down
  Sometimes silence can seem so loud
  There are miracles in life I must achieve
  But first I know it starts inside of me, ho-oh
  
  [Refrain]
  If I can see it (Woo), then I can be it
  If I just believe it, there's nothing to it
  
  [Chorus]
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can touch the sky
  I think about it every night and day
  Spread my wings and fly away
  I believe I can soar
  I see me running through that open door
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can fly
  Oh I believe I can fly (Woo)
  
  [Bridge]
  Hey, 'cause I believe in me
  Ohhh
  
  [Refrain]
  If I can see it (Woo), then I can do it (I can do it)
  If I just believe it, there's nothing to it (Hey!)
  
  [Chorus]
  I believe I can fly (Woo!)
  I believe I can touch the sky
  I think about it every night and day
  Spread my wings and fly away
  I believe I can soar
  I see me running through that open door
  I believe I can fly (I can fly)
  I believe I can fly (I can fly)
  I believe I can fly (I can fly)
  Hey, if I just spread my wings (I can fly)
  I can fly (I can fly)
  I can fly (I can fly)
  I can fly, hey (I can fly)
  If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
  I can fly (I can fly) (I can fly)
  (Woo!) (I can fly)
  
  [Outro]
  Fly-eye-eye
